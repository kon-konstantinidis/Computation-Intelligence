# Computation-Intelligence
MATLAB/Python programs for the course "Computation Intelligence" at ECE AUTH.
Projects 1 and 2 are about Fuzzy models. In particular, project 1 pertains to designing a PID controller (both conventional and fuzzy), while project 2 is about implementing a TSK regression model on both a low and a high dimensionality dataset.
Projects 3 and 4 revolve around neural networks. Project 3 is about creating a simple MLP neural network and fine tuning it, whereas project 4 requires the creation of an RBF neural network and again, fine tuning it, via hyperparameter optimization.
